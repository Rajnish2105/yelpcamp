#Yelpcamp: A service for campers

This is a idea for setting up camps for campers to stay in for there trip. Ofcourse anyone can stay here, it provides
-Location of the camp
-price
-owner
-Maps on home and details page of the pinned location on the maps
-Users can leave review on the camps about what they felt during the stay.
-A user can also post his own camp

--it has a basic authentication system to check for user and stuff
